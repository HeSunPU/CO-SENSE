[Learn a Probabilistic Sensing Strategy for Computational Imaging Design](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~hesun/)
> Optimized sensing is important for computational imaging in low-resource environments, when images must be recovered from severely limited measurements. In this paper, we propose a physics-motivated, fully  differentiable, autoencoder that learns a probabilistic sensor-sampling strategy for non-linear, correlated measurements, jointly with the image reconstruction procedure, for the purpose of optimized sensor design. The proposed method learns a system's preferred sampling distribution, modeled as an Ising model, that characterizes the correlations between different sensor selections. The learned probabilistic model is achieved by using a Gibbs sampling inspired network architecture, and yields multiple sensor-sampling patterns that perform well.

Further mathematical and implementation details are described in our paper:
